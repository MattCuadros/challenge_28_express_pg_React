> # Challenge #28 - **NodeJS - Express - SQL - React - PG - Likeme**

---

In this Challenge, i used NodeJs, Express, SQL and React for set up a Express.js server that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD operations on a 'posts' Table.

The code initializes a connection pool to the PostgreSQL database using the provided configuration options. It utilizes the dotenv package to load environment variables from a .env file.

Finally, the server provides three routes:

GET /posts: Retrieves a list of posts from the posts table in the database. It returns a JSON response containing the retrieved posts.

POST /posts: Adds a new post to the posts table. The request body should include titulo, url, and descripcion properties. The route executes an SQL INSERT query and returns a JSON response with the added post.

GET /posts/:id: Retrieves a specific post by its ID from the posts table. The route expects the ID as a route parameter. It executes an SQL SELECT query with the specified ID and returns the JSON response containing the found post.
